# PicoWAN

PicoWAN is all the best in the world format Feather and LoRa with a Raspberry Pico Core!, Feather pin to pin compatible with a USB-C port.

We love all our Feathers equally, but this Feather is very special. It's our first Feather that is specifically designed for use with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is our beginner-oriented flavor of MicroPython - and as the name hints at, its a small but full-featured version of the popular Python programming language specifically for use with circuitry and electronics.

Please note, CircuitPython does not come preloaded. See the full guide linked below for instructions on installing it
